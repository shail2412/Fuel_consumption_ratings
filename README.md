Data sets provide model-specific fuel consumption ratings and estimated carbon dioxide emissions for new light-duty vehicles for retail sale in Canada.

To help you compare vehicles from different model years, the fuel consumption ratings for 1995 to 2014 vehicles have been adjusted to reflect 5-cycle testing. Note that these are approximate values that were generated from the original ratings, not from vehicle testing.
